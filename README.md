Replications of mechanistic interpretability papers using [nnsight](https://nnsight.net) and [NDIF](https://ndif.us) for remote GPU execution.

**Status:** Replications are in progress. Each implementation lives in `replications/paper_name/` with a notebook that runs in Google Colab.

## Contributing

Claim a paper from the spreadsheet, implement it using nnterp/nnsight, and submit a PR. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full process and requirements.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Requires Python 3.12
pip install nnterp
